          <h3>My Two Year Plan In Tech</h3>
          <p>
            My two-year plan in tech is to maximize my learning to the best of
            my abilities while I build in demand applications to harness my
            skills. The sequence of my planning is as follows: Active Learning:
            I intend to actively learn the ropes of the relevant technologies
            related to the field of software engineering. These specific
            technologies include but not limited to, ReactJS, React Native,
            Angular, Python, MongoDB, SQL and server technologies. The goal of
            this process is to be proficient in front end as well as the
            back-end side of Software Engineering. Project Building: This is
            another aspect of my learning plan where I intend to utilize the
            knowledge obtained into practicable aspects by building in demand
            applications and solutions. I also intend to contribute on open
            source projects and participate in various hackathons that Iâ€™ll be
            privy to.
